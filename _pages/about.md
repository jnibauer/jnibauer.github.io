I am a 5th (and final!) year PhD student in the Department of Astrophysical Sciences at Princeton University. My research is focused on using stellar streams in the Milky Way and external galaxies to constrain dark matter, from the scale of the stellar halo down to subhalos. I will be on the academic job market in the Fall. This site serves as a repository for my past research projects and ongoing work. It also includes materials I used while teaching multivariable calculus at the University of Pennsylvania, where I was a teaching assistant for several semesters.
